// HomeController.php
public function index() {
    $featuredServices = [
        ['title' => 'Web Development', 'caption' => 'Custom websites and web applications'],
        ['title' => 'Mobile App Development', 'caption' => 'iOS and Android solutions'],
        ['title' => 'Digital Marketing', 'caption' => 'SEO, Social Media, Content Marketing'],
