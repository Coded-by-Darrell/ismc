## Development Progress

### Chapter 3: Controller-Based Routes âœ… COMPLETED
- Converted closure routes to controller-based routing
- Created HomeController, ControllerAbout, ControllerContact, ControllerService

### Chapter 4: Controllers with Data Passing âœ… COMPLETED
- Enhanced controllers to pass data using `compact()` method
- Implemented dynamic content display with Blade templates
- Added featured services and company highlights

### Chapter 5: Views and Layout System âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Create master layout system and organized view structure

**What Was Implemented:**
- âœ… **Master Layout**: `layouts/app.blade.php` with navigation and footer
- âœ… **View Inheritance**: All pages extend the master layout using `@extends('layouts.app')`
- âœ… **Section System**: Content areas defined with `@yield('content')` and `@section('content')`
- âœ… **Dynamic Titles**: Page-specific titles using `@yield('title')` and `@section('title')`
- âœ… **Organized Structure**: Views organized in `pages/` folder

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- âœ… Understanding Blade templating system
- âœ… Template inheritance with `@extends` and `@yield`
- âœ… Section management with `@section` and `@endsection`
- âœ… View organization and folder structure
- âœ… Route-Controller-View data flow

### Chapter 6: Advanced Blade Templates âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Implement advanced Blade features for dynamic content

**What Was Implemented:**
- âœ… **Conditional Display**: `@if/@elseif/@else` for time-based greetings
- âœ… **Advanced Loops**: `@foreach` and `@forelse` with empty states
- âœ… **Loop Variables**: `$loop->first`, `$loop->last`, `$loop->iteration`
- âœ… **Complex Calculations**: Average rating calculations with PHP blocks
- âœ… **Star Rating System**: Dynamic star display using `@for` loops
- âœ… **Function Calls**: `number_format()`, `count()`, `date()` in templates
- âœ… **Default Values**: Using `??` operator for fallback content

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- âœ… Advanced conditional logic in templates
- âœ… Complex data manipulation in views
- âœ… Loop control and iteration features
- âœ… Mathematical calculations in Blade
- âœ… Error handling with empty states

### Chapter 7: Blade Components & Layouts âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Create reusable components and enhanced layouts

**What Was Implemented:**
- âœ… **Anonymous Components**: `<x-service-display>` for service cards
- âœ… **Component Props**: `@props()` directive for component properties
- âœ… **Data Passing**: `:title="$variable"` syntax for prop binding
- âœ… **Nested Components**: Components calling other components
- âœ… **Layout Sections**: `@yield()` with default values and `@hasSection()`
- âœ… **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from smaller components

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- âœ… Creating reusable UI components
- âœ… Component property management
- âœ… Advanced layout inheritance
- âœ… Component composition patterns
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns

### Chapter 8: Blade Directives & Advanced Features âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Master advanced Blade directives and features

- âœ… **Asset Management**: `@push/@stack` for CSS/JS organization
- âœ… **Form Security**: `@csrf` directive implementation
- âœ… **Error Handling**: `@error` directive for form validation
- âœ… **Once Directive**: `@once` for single-execution blocks

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- âœ… Advanced authentication integration
- âœ… Modular template organization
- âœ… Asset management best practices
- âœ… Form security implementation
- âœ… Error handling in templates
- âœ… Performance optimization with `@once`

**Technical Implementation:**
```php
// Authentication-aware templates
@auth
    <p>Welcome {{ auth()->user()->name }}</p>
@endauth

// Modular template includes
@include('partials.navigation')
@include('partials.footer', ['year' => 2024])

// Asset management
@push('styles')
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/special.css">
@endpush

// Form security
<form method="POST">
    @csrf
    @error('email')
        <div class="error">{{ $message }}</div>
